# Problem Statement  
## Mental Health Counselling Platform – ITSM-Driven Service Delivery

### Executive Summary
Mental health service organizations increasingly operate at scale, serving students, employees, and individuals across geographies. While counselling demand continues to grow, service delivery operations remain largely manual, reactive, and fragmented.

Critical counselling requests, technical disruptions, and employee support issues are often managed through emails, calls, or ad-hoc escalation, resulting in missed SLAs, delayed crisis response, operational risk, and loss of trust.

This document defines the core operational problem and establishes the need for an ITSM-driven approach inspired by enterprise platforms such as ServiceNow.

### Current State (As-Is)

#### Operational Challenges
- No centralized system to manage counselling service issues
- Crisis cases depend on manual human intervention
- No SLA enforcement for high-risk scenarios
- Repeated technical issues without root cause tracking
- Counsellor burnout and HR issues handled informally
- Knowledge resources scattered across documents and chats

#### What Happens in Reality
- Users experience delays during emotionally critical moments
- Counsellors are overburdened and forced to multitask
- Leadership lacks visibility into service performance
- Compliance and reputational risks increase
- The organization relies on individuals instead of systems

> This is not a user-experience problem.  
> This is a service reliability and accountability problem.

### Core Problem Statement
Mental health service organizations lack a structured, SLA-driven service delivery system to manage counselling operations, crisis escalation, technical disruptions, and counsellor support—leading to delayed resolutions, unmanaged risk, and inconsistent service outcomes.

---

### Why Traditional Application Design Fails
Traditional app-centric solutions focus on features and interfaces but fail to address:
- Service ownership
- Priority-based escalation
- SLA enforcement
- Repeat issue prevention
- Cross-team accountability

Mental health counselling behaves like a **critical enterprise service**, not a consumer application.

---

### Why ITSM Is Required
Applying ITSM principles enables:
- Clear service definitions
- Incident vs request separation
- SLA-based accountability
- Automated escalation
- Root cause analysis
- Predictable service delivery

This project treats mental health delivery as a **mission-critical operational service**, not a support function.

---

### Impact of Not Solving This Problem
- Delayed crisis response and potential harm
- Counsellor burnout and attrition
- Increased legal and compliance exposure
- Loss of trust from users and institutions
- Inability to scale services sustainably

---

### Summary
Without structured service workflows, mental health platforms remain fragile under pressure. An ITSM-driven approach is essential to ensure reliability, safety, and long-term operational sustainability.
